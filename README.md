Step-by-step development of a Scheme-to-x86 compiler, based on
Abdulaziz Ghuloum's [paper][1], _An Incremental Approach to Compiler
Construction_, and extended draft [tutorial][2], _Compilers: Backend to
Frontend and Back to Front Again_.

The CPS conversion is based on Matt Might's [web article][3], _How to
compile with continuations_.
